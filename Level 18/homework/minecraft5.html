          <p style="font-size: 25px; color: rgb(7, 117, 64);"> <i>how to survive your first night:</i> <br> The Overworld, the blocky landscape the player finds themselves in when they spawn into a new Minecraft world, is a bright and carefree place. Well, at least during the day! The night, however, can be an experience some would call scary  especially if its their first nocturnal adventure in Minecrafts Survival mode.
 As the sun sets and darkness falls upon the world, hostile mobs will start appearing. For new players, dealing with these mobs can be challenging, and no one likes to get defeated over and over again! Especially if you dont know how to fight them, or even avoid them all together. So, how do you stay alive when monsters are creeping and groaning all around you? Luckily, theres more than one way to handle it, and how you deal with it is all up to you! <br>
